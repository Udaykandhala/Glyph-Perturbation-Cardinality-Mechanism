# Glyph-Perturbation-Cardinality-Mechanism
Glyph Perturbation Cardinality (GPC) is a raster-domain steganographic framework that embeds text, images, audio, and video directly into rendered text glyphs. Payloads are encoded as counts of minimally perturbed interior ink pixels after deterministic font rasterization, enabling reversible multimodal embedding in ordinary text.
